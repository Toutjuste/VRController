============

This program is used to transmit data by Bluetooth to a VR android applicaion as [RandCity]. Transmited data are usually the position and the rotation of the user to allow the app to move the player in a 3D world.

In the future, this app will use the kinect to detect the player and its movements.

Third-party

VRController uses some third-party libraries to work correctly

* [Qt] - used for all GUIs
* [Jenkins] - used as the continous server integration
* [BlueZ] - default linux library for Bluetooth functionnality
